    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <div class="boxed">
        <p>A duo consisting of 2shy (Rory Kennedy-Peers) and 9/5 Ghoul (Liam Kinsella). Shy is from South Manchester, Ghoul is from North Manchester, norf norf baby!
            <br>
            <p>2shy is reserved in nature, somewhat of an introvert, he lets his music talk for him. 9/5 Ghoul's got ghostly features, aptly named for his pale pigment.
                <br>
                <p>Originally work colleagues at one of Manchester's most prestigious music venues, the two established a bond over music. It would take 3 years for the two to reunite properly. After deciding to rent a studio space together, the two set about creating their debut project.</p>
                <p>Shy is the man behind production. Ambient and lofi sounds are the shyghoul signature but Shy is capable of working on any sound he turns his hand to. Both artists provide vocals, Rory assisting with melody and rap verses. Ghoul's contributions are more often than not, rap verses. Ghoul brings a darker sound to tracks due to the burnedout nature of his voice. The scummy Manc accentbrings a sense of location for the new listeners.</p>
                <p>Now Shy and Ghoul are together, one thing is certain, nothing will ever be the same. Hip Hop like you've never heard it!</p>
